Hi, I'm Guhan. I'm in my second year of computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. This fall, I'll be at Nokia writing firmware for fiber-optic modem ASICs. Currently, I'm:
* Working on something new.
* Consuming and [writing](https://guhaniyer.com) about music and other media.

If you'd like to know more about what I've done, you can find my resume [here](https://github.com/guhansiyer/resume/blob/main/output/resume.pdf).
