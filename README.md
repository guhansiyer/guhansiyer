Hi! I'm Guhan. I'm a computer engineering student at the [University of Waterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo) and firmware developer at [UW Orbital](https://github.com/UWOrbital). This winter, I'll be at [Ford](https://github.com/Ford), writing and testing security software for new vehicle ECUs. Previously, I've interned as a Systems Engineer at [NCR](https://github.com/NCR-Corporation). I'm interested in embedded systems and digital hardware design.
