Hi! I'm Guhan. I'm a computer engineering student at the [University of Waterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo) and firmware developer at [UW Orbital](https://github.com/UWOrbital). This winter, I'll be at [Ford](https://github.com/Ford), writing and testing security software on new vehicle ECUs. Previously, I've interned as a Systems Engineer at [NCR](https://github.com/NCR-Corporation), working on internal tooling for R&D. I'm interested in digital design and systems programming.
